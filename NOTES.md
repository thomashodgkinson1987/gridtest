# Session Notes

*This file is for transient, session-to-session notes. It can be cleared or updated as needed.*

- Tom suggested a new workflow:
  - When starting a major task from `PLAN.md` (e.g., "open task 1"), we should treat the action items within it as a sub-checklist.
  - I will "pull" this list and we can go through the items one by one, marking them off as we complete them.
  - This will help keep us synchronized and focused. We should discuss formalizing this process after the current logging task is complete.

- **Future Task:** Standardize logging for core objects.
  - Create helper functions (e.g., `command_to_string`, `component_to_string`) to generate consistent, formatted string representations of `Command`, `CommandResult`, and `Component` objects.
  - Refactor the logging calls to use these functions, replacing the current ad-hoc formatting.
