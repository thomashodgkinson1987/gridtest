# Session Notes

*This file is for transient, session-to-session notes. It can be cleared or updated as needed.*

- **Workflow Idea:** Dynamic Task List Generation.
  - Tom can provide a simple, high-level list (e.g., "make task list: 1. review notes, 2. commit changes").
  - I will parse this and generate a formal, structured task group in `PLAN.md` using our established `BRANCH`, `ACTION`, `GIT` format.

- **Future Task (from PLAN.md):** Error Handling in `array_macros`
    - **Topic:** Revisit the `array_macros` library to design a robust error handling strategy (e.g., returning error codes) that avoids direct logging, keeping the library decoupled.
