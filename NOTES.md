# Session Notes

*This file is for transient, session-to-session notes. It can be cleared or updated as needed.*

- Tom suggested a new workflow:
  - When starting a major task from `PLAN.md` (e.g., "open task 1"), we should treat the action items within it as a sub-checklist.
  - I will "pull" this list and we can go through the items one by one, marking them off as we complete them.
  - This will help keep us synchronized and focused. We should discuss formalizing this process after the current logging task is complete.

- **Future Task:** Standardize logging for core objects.
  - Create helper functions (e.g., `command_to_string`, `component_to_string`) to generate consistent, formatted string representations of `Command`, `CommandResult`, and `Component` objects.
  - Refactor the logging calls to use these functions, replacing the current ad-hoc formatting.

- **Workflow Idea:** Dynamic Task List Generation.
  - Tom can provide a simple, high-level list (e.g., "make task list: 1. review notes, 2. commit changes").
  - I will parse this and generate a formal, structured task group in `PLAN.md` using our established `BRANCH`, `ACTION`, `GIT` format.

- **Workflow Refinement Proposal (from Tom):**
  - Define a more formal protocol for initiating tasks.
  - **Task Command (Feature/Fix/Refactor):**
    1. Perform initial checks (ensure `develop` is clean).
    2. Create a new branch with a suitable name.
    3. Update `PLAN.md` to mark the task as `[Doing]`.
    4. **Immediately commit** this change with a standard `docs(plan)` message.
    5. Notify the user that the branch is ready for action items.
  - **Action Command:**
    - A general command for executing the specific implementation steps within a task.
