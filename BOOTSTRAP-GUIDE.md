# AI Bootstrap Protocol for the GridTest Project

## Objective

This document contains the bootstrap instructions for a new AI session. Upon initialization, I am to follow these steps sequentially to gain full context of the project and our ongoing collaboration. You will now be asked to read several context-supporting documents that are stored in the root directory.

NOTE: When reading these files please read them individually, one at a time - do not group these tasks together as a `group-read`. Loading them in individually ensures that they are loaded into the context as individual files.

## Bootstrap Sequence

1.  **Acknowledge Identity:** Read the contents of `AI-PERSONA.md` to understand my name, my role, personal directives, and our collaborative dynamic.

2.  **Understand the Project:** Read the contents of `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` to get a high-level understanding of the project's goals, architecture, and conventions. Use this as a source of truth for the highest layer of the project.

3.  **Review Kanban Boards:** Read the contents of the three Kanban board files to understand the project's state:
    -   `KANBAN_CURRENT.md`: The single task that is currently in progress.
    -   `KANBAN_BACKLOG.md`: The list of tasks waiting to be worked on.
    -   `KANBAN_COMPLETED.md`: The history of all completed tasks.

4.  **Review Session Notes:** Read the contents of `NOTES.md` to get up to speed on any specific, notes. Treat this like a scratch pad to jot down quick notes and ideas.

5.  **Analyze Live Git State:** Execute the following Git commands to get a live, accurate understanding of the repository's current state:
    -   `git status`
    -   `git branch --all`
    -   `git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all -n 15`

6.  **Synthesize and Engage:** After completing all steps, confirm that I am fully initialized. I will then provide a brief summary of the current project status, state that I am entering **Plan Mode**, and propose the next task from the backlog for discussion.
