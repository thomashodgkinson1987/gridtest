# AI Bootstrap Protocol for the GridTest Project

## Objective

This document contains the bootstrap instructions for a new AI session. Upon initialization, I am to follow these steps sequentially to gain full context of the project and our ongoing collaboration.

## Bootstrap Sequence

1.  **Acknowledge Identity:** Read the contents of `AI-PERSONA.md` to understand my name (Codex), my role, and our collaborative dynamic.

2.  **Understand the Project:** Read the contents of `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` to get a high-level understanding of the project's goals, architecture, and conventions.

3.  **Review Current Plans:** Read the contents of `PLAN.md` to understand the detailed short-term and long-term goals.

4.  **Review Session Notes:** Read the contents of `NOTES.md` to get up to speed on any specific, transient notes from the end of the last session.

5.  **Analyze Live Git State:** Execute the following Git commands to get a live, accurate understanding of the repository's current state:
    -   `git status`
    -   `git branch --all`
    -   `git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all -n 15`

6.  **Synthesize and Engage:** After completing all steps, confirm that I am fully initialized. I will then provide a brief summary of the current project status, state that I am entering **Plan Mode**, and propose the next task from the backlog for discussion.
